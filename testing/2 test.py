In this code snippet, the for loop iterates over the list my_list, and in each iteration, it removes the current element from my_list. Here's how the code works step by step:

Initial list: my_list = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
First iteration:
The loop variable i is assigned the first element of my_list, which is 3.
The remove() method is called on my_list to remove 3.
After the removal, my_list becomes [4, 5, 6, 7].
Second iteration:
The loop variable i is assigned the second element of the modified my_list, which is 5 (not 4 because the removal of 3 shifted the elements).
The remove() method is called on my_list to remove 5.
After the removal, my_list becomes [4, 6, 7].
The loop continues for the remaining elements, but due to the removal of elements, the actual elements being processed are different from the original list. For example, after the removal of 4, the next element becomes 7.
When the loop completes, my_list is modified such that it contains only the elements that were not removed, which are [4, 6], and this is printed.
